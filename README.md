The aim of this notebook is to develop an analysis of a dataset from Nuwefruit. Nuwefruit is a startup that seeks to revolutionize the habits of the population by promoting the consumption of fruit on a daily basis by selling more than 20 types of fruit.

In the first part of the notebook an exploratoty analysis of the data was performed. It enabled to:
- Analyse the sales and the activity of clients
- Evaluate the impact of the promotion

And the second part, consisted on developing a predictive model that enables to know the type of segement each client belongs to as a function of the predictive variables.

The final model achieves a F1 score of 0.8422 in train and 0.7000 in test. 

Looking forward how good it performs in the validation set. 
Building the model has been definetely a challenge (a model with a 0.70 score seems not enough for me)
